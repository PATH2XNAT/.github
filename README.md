PATH2XNAT is an [EU ISIDORe project](https://isidore-project.eu/). PATH2XNAT an integrated solution for Digital Pathomics (DP) and Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) image analysis, facilitating research into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. 

Founded by ISIDORe’s Joint Research Activities Programme 2023-2025, PATH2XNAT is a data management and analysis platform leveraging the open-source software tools [XNAT](https://www.xnat.org/) and [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/), to accelerate investigations into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. 

We are thrilled to share the launch of PATH2XNAT, a groundbreaking consortium coordinated by Erasmus MC (EMC), University Medical Centre Rotterdam, which aims to: 

 - Enhance the XNAT data management platform to accommodate Digital Pathomics (DP) and Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data. 
 - Establish connectivity between XNAT and the Galaxy analysis platform. 
 - Demonstrate the efficacy of PATH2XNAT through a study on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

PATH2XNAT is a collaborative effort that merges the capabilities of 3 European research infrastructures: Euro-BioImaging, ELIXIR, and EATRIS through a consortium comprised by the following partners: EMC, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP). This project therefore presents a true joint research action. The consortium partners have very complementary expertise: EMC, with the Population Imaging node, will expand XNAT’s capabilities to support DP and ST images and develop Galaxy workflows for DP and ST analysis. Charité  will generate ST data from SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue for testing, while the High Content Genomics and Bioinformatics team at IGTP will conduct further analysis on ST data and serve as a pilot user for the PATH2XNAT platform. 

”ISIDORe’s funding has enabled the assembly of the consortium, which will focus on the creation of PATH2XNAT, a data management and analysis platform leveraging XNAT and Galaxy, that aims to accelerate investigations into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. This enhanced platform will integrate fast-tracking workflows and preparedness tools to advance in understanding the interactions between host-pathogen that will lead to innovative prevention and treatment approaches of infectious diseases”
